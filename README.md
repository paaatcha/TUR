# University Robotic Tournament

In this repository, you can find the codes and files of the [UFES robotic team](http://www.erus.ufes.br/) developed to the III University Robotic Tournament (TUR, in Portuguese), at Federal University of Uberlândia, Brazil. This project was developed by a team composed by me, Guilherme Artém and Vanderlei Vieira.

The tournament's rules are described in [rules.pd](https://github.com/paaatcha/TUR/blob/master/rules.pdf). In brief, the competition was a robot race in which the track race had a line that the robot must follow. In addition, there were extra challenges such as slopes, dark parts, crossroads, dangers turns, etc. The robot needed to be **autonomous** and complete the track race as fast as possible.

The robot structure was developed using the 3D software [openScad](http://www.openscad.org/). Next, this structure was printed in a 3D printer and used as the robot "body".

The robot had 10 light sensors to track the line. We developed a PCB that you can find [here](http://github.com/paaatcha/TUR/eletronica).

The robot had an Arduino Mega, in which we implemented a PID control using C++. You can check out code in this [folder](https://github.com/paaatcha/TUR/tree/master/programacao).

Later, this robot became my undergraduate thesis, in which is described more detailed [here](http://github.com/paaatcha/projeto-graduacao).

Robot version 1: (you may note that in this version the robot has an Arduino UNO and the light sensors PCB wasn't the one pictured above)

Robot final version: (now it has the Arduino Mega and the developed PCB)

Take look at the robot's performance on the official race track. It's very cool to see the PID working for the 90º turn.
